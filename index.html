          were currently, if not more so, in the company, I joined. I

          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
          successfully switched careers, working as Software Engineer at a VR startup."

        <h5>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've
          never written a line of code. I needed
          some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to
          enroll by a former student of theirs
          who can only say wonderful things
          about the program. The entire
          curicculum and stuff did not
          dissapoint. They were very hands-on
          and I never had to wait long for
          assistance. The agile team project, in
          particular, was outstanding. It took
          my learning to the next level in a way
          that no tutorial could ever have. In
          fact, I've often referred to it during
          interviews as an example of my
          development experience. It certainly
          helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple
          offers. 100% recommend."
